SCENE 1
======================
After a dose of drug .........

Friend : Bro! look at those creatures. This is doom's day.

Protagonist : Nah! let's kill these motherfuckers. We are the only hope of this planet.

Friend : Yeahb let's do this. I'll rinse my mouth with their blood and make them pay for their trespassing.

Dreams Shatters

Protagonist : I guess that was just a dream. I miss those days, I miss those drugs, I miss being me. I miss my HOME.

Takes a pill and opens the door

Protagonist : oh no! It's them again. It must be a dream. But where is Charles?

Protagonist : This is for real. Charles where are you? I need you?

Protagonist : I think I'll die. This is the end ......

Friend : No it isn't because I haven't pee on their corpse.

Protagonist :  It's you charles. It's you..

SCENE 2
======================
Protagonist : I have my friend but something is still missing. What is that I don't know but it's something important.

After few minutes gazes outside the window

Protagonist : It's Valentine. I have some pretty awkward memories about this day. I still remember that time when I first had a sip of beer just to impress my crush 'Sabina'.

Sabina left with some other guy......

Protagonist : I should have given some attention to my hydration level back then.

Protagonist :  Is that Sabina at that beer counter. This must be a signal.

Sabina :  You're the one who messed up in the high school. Aren't you?

Protagonist : Yeah. That's the only thing I don't want you to remember.

Sabina : You did great today. Bye Bye.

Protagonist : Wait... there is something I want to ask you. Are you free tonight? Are you single?

Sabina : Yeah hahaha I'm glad that you finally found some courage. Yes I'm single.
